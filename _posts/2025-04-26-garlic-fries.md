Like all food blogs, I am obligated to provide my life story leading up to why I developed this recipe in a long, detailed, multi-paragraph description:

I ate some garlic fries at a restaurant, and they were delicious. I decided to recreate the recipe, and I find my recreation acceptable. You will find it below. The End.

# Recipe
Now that that's over with, we can get to the recipe. It's pretty flexible, so feel free to experiment until you decide what ratio of garlic, potatoes, etc., you like best. I have found that using an air fryer (read: the air fryer setting on my oven) is the most effective way to make them crispy, but if you don't have an air fryer, baking and broiling for a short while at the end will likely have the same effect.

## Ingredients
 - 4 cloves garlic (minced)
 - 2 pounds russet potatoes
 - Olive oil to coat fries
 - Salt
 - Pepper

## Steps
1. Slice the potatoes into slices slightly less than 1/4 inches thick. For a large potato I usually cut it into thirds long ways and then slide each third into ~3/16 inch pieces. Length and width of the fries does not matter much, but try to cut them with uniform thickness to ensure proper crispiness without burning.
2. Soak fries in water for about an hour (optional, may improve crispiness by removing starch). Drain in colander.
3. Coat fry slices in olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Air fry at 400 until crispy and slightly golden brown (15-20 minutes). Do not allow fries to touch while cooking. When using an oven, grease the baking sheet so the fries don't stick, or put in an air fryer grate. If baking, use parchment.
5. While fries are cooking, prepare a bowl of the minced garlic cloves and a couple tablespoons olive oil.
6. At the end of baking, optionally broil fries for a couple minutes to improve crispiness.
7. Once fries are crispy, remove them from the oven or air fryer and immediately transfer to the garlic olive oil bowl. Toss garlic fries until they are evenly coated in garlic and olive oil. Add additional salt to taste if needed.
8. Optionally put all fries in oven at about 400 to warm with oil and garlic, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.


## Some important notes:
I recommend minced garlic over crushed. Crushed garlic can end up a bit stringy, which messes up the garlic distribution over the potatoes. You can crush the garlic and then chop it afterwards to counter this.

You may want to experiment with how much salt and garlic you need based on your taste.

I may update this recipe as I make improvements. You can find the edit history in the [git history of the page](https://github.com/EthShaw/EthShaw.github.io/commits/master/_posts/2025-04-26-garlic-fries.md).
